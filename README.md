This sample repository is a reference for the Fordham University CISC2350 class: [Information and Web Programming](https://github.com/yurm04/CISC2350).  The repo is meant to be used as a student submission point for assignmnets and projects.  

Each student should set up their own, personal assignments repo by following the [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/yurm04/CISC2350/blob/master/notes/lecture5/1-AssignmentRepo.md) found in the main class repository.  The guide has details on how to set up your local repo, how to create a remote GitHub repo, linking your remote repo to your local, and the format to submit your weekly assignments and projects.
